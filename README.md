# Daily-Calander (Workday Scheduler)
This project utilizes javascript and moment.js to allow users to dynamically add tasks to this daily planner.

## Motivation
My hope was to create a useful web api that will give users an easier way to keep track of their busy lives.

## Screenshots

## Features
Utilizes local storage to keep track of your tasks.
Dynamically changes so you know what you have next.

## How to Use?
Click into any row that is highlighted in green, to add tasks that you plan to complete later in the day.
Red rows are what need to be completed now.
Grey rows are thing that have past and can no longer be completed.

## Credits
I'd like to give a huge shoutout to the Triology staff for giving me the necessary tools I needed to complete this task!
