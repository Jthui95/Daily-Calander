# Daily-Calander (Workday Scheduler)
This project utilizes javascript and moment.js to allow users to dynamically add tasks to this daily planner.

## Motivation
My hope was to create a useful web application that will give users an easier way to keep track of their busy lives.

## Features
Utilizes local storage to keep track of your tasks.
Dynamically changes so you know what you have next.

## How to Use?
Add any task you would like into the highlighted box. Once you have added a task press save and your task will be there even if you refresh the webpage!

## Credits
I'd like to give a huge shoutout to the Triology staff for giving me the necessary tools I needed to complete this task!
